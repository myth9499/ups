Hi there.
<br>
<p>You have a problem. So do I. What you are trying to do is the subject of
<br>
my pains since few days and it has proven to be fairly difficult to
<br>
handle. Due to numerous issues, there is only one way I can go: use wide
<br>
charracters (type wchar_t) internally and UTF-8 externally. When one set
<br>
to such a way needs to use libxml in its present form, there are two
<br>
possibilities:
<br>
<p>1. Write a surrogate for each and every libxml function which operates
<br>
on strings and make the surrogate convert all involved strings before
<br>
and/or after the call to the real libxml function. The same applies when
<br>
accessing any data member of any structure in libxml which contains a
<br>
string. Well, if you are using just a few libxml functions, this is not
<br>
a big problem to do. If you however use a lot of them, it is a pure
<br>
terror. Depending on how often your program calls into libxml, it can
<br>
represent a performance penalty. Good thing about it is that it need be
<br>
done once, provided libxml interface doesn't change.
<br>
<p>2. Modify libxml and make xmlChar type resemble wchar_t, instead of
<br>
unsigned char. In this case, libxml would have to convert from/to UTF-8
<br>
whenever it reads from, or writes to, any external storage (file,
<br>
http...). This is considerable if, and only if you use a whole lot of
<br>
libxml functions and call them often. However, it means producing a new,
<br>
private version of libxml and keeping it in sync with the public one for
<br>
all times. No, even if that would be my (and your) salvation, the
<br>
official libxml cannot be modified in this manner. That would
<br>
mercilessly break each and every libxml-based program out there, in
<br>
addition to loosing support for every platform which does not have an
<br>
ISO-10646 implementation. (Is there such platform?)
<br>
<p>To convert strings between wide charracter and UTF-8 representations
<br>
under Win32, I would use WidecharToMultiByte and MultiByteToWideChar
<br>
functions, which are a part of the operating system NLS interface.
<br>
<p>I wish you a lot of luck.
<br>
