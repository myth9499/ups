Hi there.
<br>
<p>I have a different opinion on that and would like to express it herewith.
<br>
<p>No offense meant, Alejandro, but I think checking if you read from a
<br>
directory or not is your responsibility. Libraries like libxml (and libxml2)
<br>
should not go any deeper into the matter of checking if a passed parameter
<br>
is sane or not.
<br>
<p>Consider that libxml2 is based on other libraries (libc, for example). I am
<br>
writing libraries atop of libxml and yet other persons over here write
<br>
libraries atop of mine. One program or another shall be based on the
<br>
highest-level library and shall sooner or later make a call which would
<br>
partly execute down in libxml2. If now every library along the way would
<br>
check the sanity of the parameter, each and every parameter would be checked
<br>
three times, four times, five times, depends on how deep from the surface
<br>
the call implementation is.
<br>
<p>Further, consider strlen function from libc, for example. What happens if
<br>
you pass it NULL? It trashes your program, it does not return an error. A
<br>
crash is far louder an alarm, signaling a grave error in the program and
<br>
urging correction.
<br>
<p>I am simply against the library acting as a shield before programmer's own
<br>
mistakes. What would be next? Patching strlen routine in glibc so it checks
<br>
for NULL argument before parsing the string and, if it is NULL, sends an
<br>
email to strlenwatch@localhost, sets the appropriate errno and returns -1?
<br>
Correctness and sanity of parameters any program passes to any library
<br>
function must be enforced by the program itself. No library can ever know
<br>
better what the program is about to do.
<br>
<p>Now, if you really need to have it, putting some kind of assert in libxml2
<br>
which fires when a parameter is unsane would be a far better solution in my
<br>
eyes. Such an assert would state clearly what sort of parameters the library
<br>
expects, would have a good alarming effect if things go wrong and would be
<br>
optimised out by the compiler when making a productive release.
<br>
<p>Igor
