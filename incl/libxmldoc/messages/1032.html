<p>As Daniel said, I started working on this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, how far did you get, and is the sourcecode available

</em><br>
<p>Currently not very far.
<br>
I started thinking on the contexts and began coding the extension
<br>
functions for XPath (document() is nearly done, others in the TODO list).
<br>
At the moment, the code is only on my hard disk. It isn't consistent
<br>
enough to have been made public.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A feasible approach seems to be to start with evaluating existing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>That's what I began to do with Sablotron from Ginger Alliance
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.gingerall.com/">http://www.gingerall.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
In my opinion, the first thing to do is to define the structures for
<br>
accessing templates and the processor context (and probably also a parser
<br>
context).
<br>
Then implement tree parsing (the part on preserving blanks seems to be
<br>
quite difficult to resolve, with my today's programming knowledge) and
<br>
first processing (templates and apply-templates and all node creation XSLT
<br>
elements in a first time, then add the other stuff : output, variables and
<br>
params, loops and tests, etc.)
<br>
<p>The reason why I began working on the XSLT functions is to familiarize
<br>
(is this english ?) me with XPath and its internal behaviour.
<br>
<p>Oh, Daniel, I think all implicit and explicit XPath functions should be
<br>
made public, or at least in a xpathInternals.h, for XPath extension
<br>
facilities (for example, in the document() XSLT function, we need to convert
<br>
the first argument to a string (xmlXPathStringFunction) unless it's a
<br>
node-set in which case we need to merge different node-sets
<br>
(xmlXPathNodeSetMerge)).
<br>
<p>Bjorn, contact me in private to discuss about all of this.
