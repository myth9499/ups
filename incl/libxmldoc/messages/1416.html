Hi,
<br>
<p>I feel that my original comment could use a little clarification.
<br>
<p>First, I tried using &quot;iconv&quot;, but it didn't really cut it for a couple of
<br>
reasons, not the least of which was the fact that its use was completely opaque
<br>
on my Red Hat  linux box - man iconv, man -k iconv, man unicode, etc. produce
<br>
nothing appropriate.  I searched around for the data files, etc. to no avail.
<br>
There are man pages on my solaris box, but they aren't really appropriate, as
<br>
the character encodings actually SEEM to have different names (cross platform
<br>
transparency is critical to my app).
<br>
<p>Our friends at Red Hat could use a little prodding as far as the doc goes.
<br>
Doing a search for &quot;iconv&quot; on the RedHat sites turns up nothing useful.
<br>
<p>May I suggest adding a link to the online Linux iconv documentation to the
<br>
xmlsoft.org web site?
<br>
<p>Secondly, the data from which I am building my document is coming from various
<br>
sources, some in utf-8, some in &quot;wrong endian&quot; utf-16 (Oracle), some in &quot;wierd&quot;
<br>
and basically unpredictable multi-byte Asian character encodings.  In my case
<br>
it actually makes sense to convert to a &quot;neutral&quot; utf-16 intermediate
<br>
encoding.  Also I am dealing with a situation where I need to be told on the
<br>
fly what destination encoding to use from a very large range of Asian character
<br>
encodings - ICU makes this much easier because it accepts just about anything
<br>
the user might enter as the name of the encoding.  It also provides support for
<br>
collating and sorting, etc.
<br>
<p>Finally, I had meant to add that I certainly appreciate the work that went into
<br>
putting iconv support into libxml, and understand that it IS the standard and
<br>
that it should be used when possible and didn't mean to imply that it was a
<br>
wrong choice in any way.  No doubt in most cases it is more than adequate.
<br>
ICU probably is more than most people would need and is a bit fat, but it works
<br>
very well and is copiously documented.
<br>
