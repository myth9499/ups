If you want to write a document to a file handle, you can use xmlDocDump.
<br>
If you want to write a document to memory, you can use xmlDocDumpMemory.
<br>
If you want to write just an element (not an entire document) to a file
<br>
handle, you can use xmlElemDump.
<br>
I want to write just an element (not an entire document) to memory; I want
<br>
to use xmlElemDumpMemory.  But xmlElemDumpMemory does not exist.
<br>
<p>Could xmlElemDumpMemory be created?  It looks to me, from a first look at
<br>
tree.c, like it would be really easy to do.  xmlDocDumpMemory differs only
<br>
slightly from xmlDocDump, and it seems to me that the same difference
<br>
could be applied to xmlElemDump to create xmlElemDumpMemory.  It's
<br>
important because as far as I can tell there is no other way to turn just
<br>
*part* of a tree into flat data in memory; if I want to do that, at the
<br>
moment I have to write an entire new XML generator of my own and traverse
<br>
the tree myself instead of letting libxml do it.  I suppose another
<br>
solution would be to graft my subtree into a separate document of its own,
<br>
generate the XML for the document, and then strip out the prolog, but
<br>
that's not a great solution either.
<br>
<p>Given that you can write documents to file handles, documents to memory,
<br>
and elements to file handles, it seems like you should be able to write
<br>
elements to memory.  Furthermore, if you had to choose just one of
<br>
xmlElemDump and xmlElemDumpMemory, I think xmlElemDumpMemory is a lot more
<br>
useful anyway - because if I want to send the resulting fragment of XML to
<br>
a file, I can do that afterwards, whereas if I want to recover the data
<br>
for further processing in my program, it's practically impossible to do
<br>
that with xmlElemDump.  I'd probably have to create some kind of buffered
<br>
pipe to myself to make xmlElemDump work; a really yicky solution.
<br>
<p>Just for my own use I can easily modify my copy of libxml to provide this
<br>
function - but it would be really unpleasant if I had to distribute a
<br>
modified libxml to every user of my app.
