<br>
Igor does raise an interesting question as to whether libxml should or
<br>
should not check to see if a filename points to a directory before
<br>
actually open it and attempting to parse it.  My reasoning is that,
<br>
even though there are some valid points as to why it should not do it,
<br>
it should.  In this message I'll explain my arguments as to why it
<br>
should do it.
<br>
<p>My setup is as follows.  I guess it is pretty common.  My program asks
<br>
the user to pickup a file (showing an appropiate file/URL dialog) and
<br>
immediately asks libxml to parse it.  The following options are
<br>
possible:
<br>
<p>1. I don't check to see if the user is attempting to open a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directory, I still try to read XML from it.  Rather than seeing an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropiate message telling him he picked a directory, he sees
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messages telling him how the contents of the directory are not a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valid XML document.
<br>
<p>2. Before calling the functions in libxml, my program makes sure the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;user did not pick a directory.  If it did, boom, it signals an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error.  If it didn't, it does call libxml's parsing functions.
<br>
<p>3. The checks are added inside libxml, right next to the open(2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls.
<br>
<p>One might argue for the first option, stating that it will make the
<br>
program more flexible than the others.  Sure, if the user does tell us
<br>
to try to read XML from a directory, however absurd it might sound to
<br>
us, the programmers, let's not assume he made a mistake and lets
<br>
actually do what he told us.  In reality, there will hardly ever be
<br>
any motivation to open a directory and parse it as XML, while it is a
<br>
common user mistake to select a directory (in the file-selection
<br>
dialog I'm using) rather than a file.  Lets not waste much time
<br>
talking about this option and discard it already.
<br>
<p>Arguments for the second option exist as well.  Igor states that
<br>
&quot;Libraries like libxml (and libxml2) should not go any deeper into the
<br>
matter of checking if a passed parameter is sane or not.&quot;  Having
<br>
every different library repeat the same check all over again is one of
<br>
the problems he states.
<br>
<p>Besides, if the programmer tells libxml to actually parse XML from a
<br>
directory, libxml should not try to be smarter (&quot;Hey, BonzoProgrammer,
<br>
that's an error, you crap!&quot;) but rather do exactly what the programmer
<br>
wanted, however absurd.  Like Igor says, the library shouldn't act as
<br>
a shield against programmer's own mistakes.  And, again, flexibility.
<br>
<p>But I said that in this message I would argue for the 3rd option.  So
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>First, I don't agree with the strlen example and I think Igor abuses
<br>
it.  I could talk about other examples where functions in libc (at
<br>
least in glibc's implementation) do make those check against NULL
<br>
pointers (such as printf(&quot;%s&quot;, NULL) or free(NULL)).  Also (though you
<br>
might just ignore this argument if you don't agree with it), libxml's
<br>
xmlParseFile and strlen are completely different in that the first is
<br>
a high-level function that is supposed to be called once or twice
<br>
during the whole program execution (where adding a few microseconds of
<br>
delay does not matter), while strlen is a low-lever function that must
<br>
be -fast-.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am simply against the library acting as a shield before
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programmer's own mistakes. What would be next? Patching strlen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;routine in glibc so it checks for NULL argument before parsing the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string and, if it is NULL, sends an email to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strlenwatch@localhost, sets the appropriate errno and returns -1?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correctness and sanity of parameters any program passes to any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library function must be enforced by the program itself. No
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library can ever know better what the program is about to do.
<br>
<p>I agree completely with your second paragraph.
<br>
<p>However, you see, correctness and sanity of parameters are completely
<br>
relative to the function's precondition.
<br>
<p>Following your logic, why bother checking the return value for the
<br>
open(2) call in libxml at all?  After all, the programmer passed a
<br>
filename that can't be opened so it's his fault for not establishing
<br>
the correctness and sanity of parameters.
<br>
<p>Would you suggest that everyone who calls functions on libxml to parse
<br>
a file better calls open(2) on the file to make sure it can be opened
<br>
or else the unpredictable will happen?
<br>
<p>Currently, the (implicit) precondition is &quot;pass a filename that points
<br>
to a file (not directory; if it points to directory, errors will
<br>
occur)&quot;.  So yes, for that precondition, you must make sure your
<br>
filename does point to a file, not a directory.  I am just proposing
<br>
changing that (again, implicit) precondition to &quot;pass a filename that
<br>
can point to both a file or a directory and let libxml signal an error
<br>
if it is a directory&quot;.
<br>
<p>There is more to this, however.
<br>
<p>The functions in libxml receive a ``filename'' but hey, it can be a
<br>
URL too.  Before actually calling open on ``filename'', libxml checks
<br>
it to see if it is an HTTP URL, an FTP URL or something that must be
<br>
passed to open(2).  And, of course, it only gets open(2)ed if it isn't
<br>
a URL.  So doing things your way, with these checks on the caller
<br>
programs, everybody and their dog would have to copy and paste all the
<br>
code that, given the ``filename'', checks to see if it is an HTTP URL,
<br>
FTP URL or, finally, something that will get passed to open.  Only
<br>
then, when the caller programs notices it is something that will get
<br>
passed to open(2), it can call stat.
<br>
<p>What would be next? Patching all libxml caller programs so they
<br>
contain a modified version of all the code in libxml such that, before
<br>
actually calling functions in libxml, they know for sure nothing will
<br>
fail inside them and, in case they find errors (hey, the contents of
<br>
this URL that libxml will eventually download looking for XML does not
<br>
parse correctly), log them calling syslog(3) and family, send an email
<br>
to couldntestablishcorrectnessinparametersforlibxml@localhost and
<br>
call raise(SIGSEGV)?
<br>
<p>Well, even if we did this, as libxml is supposed to evolve, the checks
<br>
might change and the programs' versions of them will get out-of-sync.
<br>
<p>The reasoning behind having libxml accept URLs as well as filenames
<br>
and handling it all automatically is (I'm guessing) to allow the
<br>
programmer to forget about this (which is the whole purpose of
<br>
libraries).  The programmer just gets a resource descriptor of some
<br>
kind and libxml will take care of finding out what it is (file, FTP
<br>
URL, HTTP URL...) and how to read it.  I fail to see why would it be
<br>
wrong to add a call to stat(2) to check if ``filename'' is a file or a
<br>
directory in a function that is already examining if ``filename'' is a
<br>
path or a URL.
<br>
<p>But I still need to make that patch. :)
<br>
<p>Thanks.
<br>
<p>Alejo.
