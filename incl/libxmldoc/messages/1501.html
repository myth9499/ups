<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As libxml uses UTF-8 internally, it seems to me that the only proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution to your suggestion would be to insert a wrapper layer for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SAX functions. The purpose of this layer would be to convert the data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into to the application-requested encoding and then pass the data on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the application through the &quot;real&quot; SAX interface.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly what I intended to suggest.  Permit the user to control
<br>
the encoding used in callbacks without putting the burden on the user to
<br>
convert from an undesired encoding to the desired encoding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would like to support Craig's idea of putting this wrapper in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;application, since it is the one that is dependent on a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encoding. You can use the functions from libxml to do this conversion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for you (this is fairly easy; I have done something similar for UTF-8
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to HTML).
</em><br>
<p>Yes it is easy to copy and paste, but that is error prone and bad design.  
<br>
This is what Larry Wall calls &quot;false laziness&quot;.  If a large fraction of 
<br>
people who use SAX end up copying and pasting the same chunk of code then 
<br>
libxml has missed a chance to increase software reliability.  You have 
<br>
copied and pasted chunks of the library source as have I.  This is not a 
<br>
good solution.  libxml is quite good at doing various encodings, using 
<br>
iconv, potentially ones not in existence yet.  Why not make this power
<br>
available to the users of the library in a fashion convenient for the apps?
<br>
<p>Some of the arguments I have read in this thread against seem to assume 
<br>
that every project which uses XML will encounter documents in many 
<br>
encodings and that it is better to simply use UTF8 so that the app doesn't
<br>
encounter &quot;a myriad&quot; of undesired encodings.  In the project I am working 
<br>
on, we are using XML to send data over the network from one app to another.
<br>
<p>So we control the encoding of every document.  If our app(s) were processing
<br>
documents in
<br>
numerous encodings, then getting all of the characters in UTF8 would be 
<br>
better than a &quot;myriad&quot; of encodings.  However since we control both ends
<br>
of our transactions, and we use only a single encoding, UTF8 becomes a 
<br>
burden not a convenience.  It turns out that oddly enough for systems like
<br>
ours a naive XML parser is preferable to libxml because we do not have to
<br>
deal w/ an additional encoding.
