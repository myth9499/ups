<em>&gt; I grabbed the libxml2-2.2.5 tar file from the gnome ftp server, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encountered a problem building it using the MinGW build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment
</em><br>
<p>2.2.5 doesn't seem to work out-of-the-box for MSVC++6, either. (But a huge
<br>
thank-you to Daniel for aiming to do this! The effort and difficulty is very
<br>
much appreciated given that the Windows platform is so different and lacking
<br>
in places.)
<br>
<p>I should point out that I've only just started looking at LibXml (I wish I
<br>
had found it before Xerces-C) and that I have very little experience with
<br>
things like the build-configuration scripts which I don't think I can run on
<br>
Windows. (I think I understand what they do, though. :)) I apologise in
<br>
advance for my ignorance and anything stupid that I say!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I had to edit include/win32config.h to add this line:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #define SOCKLEN_T size_t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure if other Win32 build environments have this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem or not.
</em><br>
<p>I also had errors because of this when I initally tried to build.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One other thing I noticed:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's an extra copy of config.h and acconfig.h in the include/libxml
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dir, so I removed them both just to be sure that they weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causing any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.  You might want to change the tar-building rules to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting these files in there.
</em><br>
<p>config.h and acconfig.h don't seem to make a difference for me, but as I say
<br>
I don't have a good understanding of the configuration stuff.
<br>
<p>Additional comments about building on VC6:
<br>
<p>As well as SOCKLEN_T being undefined, as mentioned above, I had errors
<br>
because iconv.h could not be found. I'll admit my ignorance again and say
<br>
that I don't know what iconv is but I saw in previous posts that LibXml has
<br>
been compiled with VC6 by disabling most of the optional stuff, so I edited
<br>
include/libxml/xmlversion.h and changed all of the &quot;#if 1&quot; lines to &quot;#if 0&quot;,
<br>
which is fine for me as I'm just using XML as my configuration file format.
<br>
<p>Having done this I only get two problems:
<br>
<p>(One)
<br>
<p>parserinternals.c(1032) : warning C4018: '&gt;' : signed/unsigned mismatch
<br>
<p>I'll just ignore the warning for now. I think it's because &quot;used&quot; is not
<br>
explicitly unsigned:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int used;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (in-&gt;buf-&gt;buffer-&gt;use &gt; used + 2 * INPUT_CHUNK)
<br>
<p>(Two)
<br>
<p>xmlio.c(1509) : warning C4013: 'getcwd' undefined; assuming extern returning
<br>
int
<br>
(This causes a third knock-on error because of the assumed return type.)
<br>
<p>Adding &quot;#include &lt;direct.h&gt;&quot; to the top of xmlio.c fixed this.
<br>
<p><p>Another Windows thing:
<br>
<p>In xmlmemory.h:
<br>
typedef void *(*xmlMallocFunc)(int);
<br>
typedef void *(*xmlReallocFunc)(void *, int);
<br>
<p>This causes a minor problem on VC6 since Malloc and Realloc take size_t,
<br>
defined as unsigned int, rather than int. (Of course, int is signed by
<br>
default, else there would not be a problem.) A simple cast when calling
<br>
xmlMemSetup gets around this but I thought I would mention it. (BTW, many
<br>
thanks for the well thought-out way this is done to avoid problems with the
<br>
library using incompatible memory functions!)
