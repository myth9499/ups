<em>&gt;   Of course libxml is both a generator and a parser ... But to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to generate it *needs* to understand the in-memory storage format. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you decide to not use the libxml tree format, for whatever reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how libxml could &quot;magically&quot; understand your encoding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the data. Try to think 2 minutes about this there is no obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution for this !
</em><br>
<p>I've actually thought about this so much that I actually *have a working
<br>
generator* that needs no &quot;in-memory storage format&quot;, beyond whatever
<br>
tree/list structure that is implicit in the data itself.
<br>
<p>Rather than defining rigid, stifling, data structures, you just play
<br>
around with some function and object pointers instead.  {ie, rigid,
<br>
stifling, interfaces.}  Naturally, this is alot cleaner in a so-called
<br>
&quot;civilized&quot; languages like C++, but it can be done easily [though
<br>
tediously] enough in C as well.
<br>
<p>Add in some helpers for conversion to and from core data types like
<br>
strings, deals with the standard entity stuff, numbers and you have
<br>
something which can deal with about 90% of the &quot;work&quot; one is likely to
<br>
do with XML.  [Well, the work *I've* done at least..]
<br>
<p>The result is effectively an inverse of a SAX parser.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Failing that, allowing one to use the streams libXML reads from in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; output mode would be nice [thus one gets compression 'for free'].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Parse error. I cannot understand this sentence...
</em><br>
<p>Translation:  expose a &quot;stream&quot; thingee which has nice, easy to use functions
<br>
a la fread, fwrite(), but can do the compression dance if necessary.
<br>
<p>I am aware this is probably well beyond the purview of an XML parser though,
<br>
but I suspect a parser could make excellent use of such a thing.  Example:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  May I suggest people actaully *look* at what is available before starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting modifying/extending the library ? All the output routines are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available in tree.c.
</em><br>
<p>Inside tree.c is a bunch of &quot;buffer&quot; stuff.  Now I haven't used it myself,
<br>
but reading around in the code, it looks like you hand someone a complete
<br>
document [in the &quot;in-memory storage format&quot;] and it proceeds to
<br>
generate the XML [optionally compressed?] into another in-memory buffer,
<br>
and this buffer is finally slopped to a file.
<br>
<p>If this understanding is correct, the primary issue is the usual one:
<br>
memory consumption.  Namely, one will have the source data in-memory
<br>
[unavoidable [*]], an in-memory document tree, and, the in-memory XML
<br>
equivalent of this tree.
<br>
<p>For piddly small documents like web-pages and the like, this is probably
<br>
bearable.  But for multi-megabyte monsters, it would be better if the
<br>
memory footprint for a simple &quot;save&quot; operation be nominal to non-existant.
<br>
<p>This is probably easiest done when one has a nifty stream gizmo into
<br>
which one just dribbles the XML straight out of the application's
<br>
objects, and this eventually makes it to the disk (or socket connection
<br>
or whereever).  Net memory hit is independent of document size, and might
<br>
be a mighty 4k if one is feeling decadent the day the code is written... ;-)
<br>
<p>[*] In the application area I am interested in, there is really a continuous
<br>
stream of source data.  So even though the total amount of data is, in
<br>
principle at least, unbounded, the actual data being dealt with at any
<br>
time is O(100 bytes).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                       I also strongly suggest that if your interested going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that deep in the technical details of the library, then your should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the CVS tree to see what is really there and not an ancient version.
</em><br>
<p>I am looking at, and using, libxml2.0.0.
