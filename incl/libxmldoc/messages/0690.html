<p>No, I didn't ment this. So I try to be more clearer.
<br>
<p>The WML ompiler gets the WML document, uses libxml to make up 
<br>
a DOM tree out of it and then runs through the tree node by node 
<br>
changing tags into one byte binary relevants and putting them 
<br>
together with the text contents of those nodes. A little example: 
<br>
<p>Input:
<br>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE wml PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD WML 1.1//EN&quot;
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml">http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/wml_1.1.xml</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
&lt;wml&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;card id=&quot;main&quot; title=&quot;Tervehdys&quot; newcontext=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Hyv‰‰ p‰iv‰‰ maailma!&lt;/p&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/card&gt;
<br>
&lt;/wml&gt;
<br>
<p>Output:
<br>
\x01\x04j\x00\x7f\xe7U\x03main\x006\x03Tervehdys\x00#\x01`
<br>
\x03Hyv\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4 p\xc3\xa4iv\xc3\xa4\xc3\xa4 maailma!\x00
<br>
\x01\x01\x01
<br>
<p>Well, now there's a little problem with the output, since the third byte 
<br>
('j' or 0x6a) of the binary is equivalent to XML clause
<br>
encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; 
<br>
but as you can see, those scandinavian characters are still in the UTF-8 
<br>
because they are just copied from the tree node. So what I need is to
<br>
change 
<br>
UTF-8 characters to something else. (Note that I use ISO-8859-1 only as
<br>
an 
<br>
example here, since my cellular doesn't happen to understand russian,
<br>
greek or
<br>
arabian...) If that kind of function seems to fall out of libxml's
<br>
territory,
<br>
well, it's ok for me, but I'd rather use some encoding facilities in the
<br>
libxml,
<br>
since depending on a yet another library doesn't sound as a good idea. 
<br>
<p>Padon me, if this sounds like a stupid question, but I'm not very
<br>
familiar 
<br>
with the libxml implementation, so far I have mostly just installed it
<br>
and 
<br>
upgraded it time to time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   So you already loaded the document, and everything is in memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus the initial document was XML (unless there is a bug in libxml).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you want to do is translate this document into something else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right ?
</em><br>
<p>Or retain the original character set encoding that has been internally 
<br>
changed to UTF-8, see above.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   Which would need to force the DOM tree to add one extra charset item
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for each of those elements in the tree. People are already complaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the DOM generation is a bit heavy memory wise, I'm pretty sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of people would not be pleased with this, at all...
</em><br>
<p>No, of course the same character set is used throughout the document.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Practically what you can do:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     - reuse the _private field defined for most objects, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       4 bytes where you could try to store informations, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       you won't be able to save the document with libxml native
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       functions.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, no document are saved, the DOM tree is freed after the 
<br>
binary form is formed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     - try to force libxml to store in the native encoding, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       is a small paragraph at <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/encoding.html#extend">http://xmlsoft.org/encoding.html#extend</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       about this, but I suggest not to do this, or make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       you don't violate any of the XML well formedness rules due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       to this trick (*)
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; (*) WAP implementors have already being accused by the XML community
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to violate Well Formedness rules of XML by defaulting to ISO-Latin-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     when no encoding was declared in the XML declaration, nor in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     HTTP headers. I would not be pleased if libxml was pointed as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     one of those lousy implementation. This was true in libxml1 but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     have tried to make sure that this got corrected in libxml2.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that was really a good change to do. Now if I just got this problem 
<br>
solved I could bury libxml1 compability on my project.
