<p>Here's what I found wrong and (in most cases) fixed:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Several .c files were including &quot;xmlversion.h&quot; rather than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;libxml/xmlversion.h&gt;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ There is an undefined call to xmlXPathFreeLocationSet() in xpath.c.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This might be because xpointer.[ch] are not in the tar file, but I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just #if-0-ed the call out of the source for now.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ The Makefile.in was still trying to create libxml, even with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include/libxml dir existing.  I changed this so that the Makefile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looks for include/libxml, and creates &quot;include&quot; as a dir and puts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the libxml symlink into the include dir if it is missing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Changed configure.in to create &quot;include&quot; as a directory with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;libxml&quot; symlink inside it.  It looks like the code that was supposed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to create these items inside the build dir (when it differs from the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src dir) was broken, and I think I fixed it (though I didn't try to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;configure things from an separate build dir).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Removed include/libxml/config.h.in, as it is not needed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ The LIBXML_VERSION defines in win32include.h.in are duplicates of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defines in xmlversion.h, so I removed them.  This makes the file
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no @...@ expansions, so I just renamed the *.in version to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the .h version and removed it from the configure.in file.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ The win32include.h file should not be in the include/libxml dir
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(since it doesn't get installed).  I moved it into the include dir.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Changed all the .h dependencies (or it wouldn't compile).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Added the file win32/Makefile.mingw, which is a simplified Makefile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that builds the library, a DLL, and the tools using the mingw gcc
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compiler.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ I tweaked the win32/README.MSDev to remove all mention of copying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.h files and commenting out the LIBXML_VERSION* defines, added a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comment that the diff is out of date now, and mention the build
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructions for using the &quot;mingw&quot; gcc compiler.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ I changed the include/libxml/libxmlversion.h file that was included
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the tar file so that LIBXML_ICONV_ENABLED is not defined.  I like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact that this file is there, as it means that MSWin developers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can have an easier file to tweak (and it works without change after my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fix if you're using the mingw compiler), and it gets replaced by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal configuration process for other folks.
<br>
<p>A patch is appended.  To summarize what to do after the patch:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# After running &quot;patch -p0 &lt;wayne.patch&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rm include/libxml/config.h.in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mv include/libxml/win32config.h.in include/win32config.h
<br>
<p>TODO:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Remove #if-0 from xpath.c and solve build problem.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;+ Figure out why example/Makefile.in doesn't exist (this is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-standing problem with libxml, but it just seems to cause
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;configure to complain).
