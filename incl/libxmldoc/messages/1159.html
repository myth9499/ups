<em>&gt;   There will be a call to the entity loader to fetch DTD with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; URI computed from:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    - the URL of DOC
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    - the URI-Reference for DTD stored in DOC
</em><br>
<p>Your explanation matches with what I expected.
<br>
<p>Just to clarify, so there isn't any confusion on my part or anyone
<br>
else's: in my case the document is just a string in memory, and 
<br>
the reference to the DTD in the document is:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!DOCTYPE test_doc SYSTEM &quot;complex.dtd&quot;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   When the URI-Reference to ENT is found in DTD, there will be a call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the entity loader to fetch ENT with the URI computed from:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    - the URL of DTD as found in the result returned by the previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      invocation to get DTD
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    - the URI-Reference for ENT stored in DTD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So yes there is 2 call to the entity loader, and yes it's normal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume you agree.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree that there will be a call to the entity loader for each
<br>
external entity which must be used by libxml.  If I my DTD includes
<br>
two entity files, then there will be three calls.  This matches with
<br>
my expectations, and matches my observations prior to submitting the
<br>
patch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Now you seem surprized because the URI computed for ENT by libxml
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is actually the right one (i.e. with the extra path already added).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is that still right ?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that surprised me.  I was expecting libxml to use the entity loader
<br>
to resolve the &quot;right&quot; URI for the entities.  When I submitted my patch, 
<br>
I did not understand why libxml would be calling my entity loader if it 
<br>
already knew how to find the entity file in question.  For example, if 
<br>
libxml already knew to find the file complex.ent as /dvl/fds/dtd/complex.ent, 
<br>
why would it call the entity loader at all?  What additional information
<br>
is the entity loader supposed to provide, in that case?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   If yes, this is simply because libxml store more information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than you expected the simple hack in you entity loaded is to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top call the existing default one and only add the prefix if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed. 
</em><br>
<p>In pseudocode:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new_entity_loader()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result = default_loader()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(result == NULL)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tack &quot;/dvl/fds/dtd&quot; on front
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return xmlNewInputFromFile() for the new path
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return result
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br>
<p>I have tested this, and it works fine other than the error message
<br>
I will get each time my entity loader is given my DTDs (since the
<br>
default entity loader will never be able to resolve my DTDs). 
<br>
<p>My other option is to make sure that I only add the path to the
<br>
front if it's not already there.  This isn't any more difficult
<br>
than the solution described above, and the net result is the
<br>
same.  The code will work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you will have to resort to an hack unless you keep a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catalog i.e. an association between not the URL but the PUBLIC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identifier of the DTD and it's actual path.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand this, though.  If I'm mapping &quot;complex.dtd&quot;
<br>
to &quot;/dvl/fds/dtd/complex.dtd&quot;, isn't that what you're asking for?
<br>
In any case, the actual path to the DTD varies depending on the
<br>
machine my TIBCO listener is running on.  I think I am unsure of 
<br>
which PUBLIC identifier you are referring to in my example.
<br>
<p>I can see that I do not quite have an understanding of what is going 
<br>
on here, but I guess I can get my code to work, and that was what I 
<br>
was aiming for, anyway.
<br>
<p>Thank you for the detailed reply.  If you have time, I would really 
<br>
appreciate an on-list or off-list explanation of my main question here: 
<br>
that is, why does libxml have to call the entity loader if it already 
<br>
knows how to find the entity in question?  That is the one piece which
<br>
still really makes no sense to me.
<br>
<p>Thanks again...
<br>
<p>KEN
