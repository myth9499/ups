<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMHO, getting the characters in the SAX callbacks in the encoding of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;document is the worst of all choices. Now the application has to know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about myriads of encodings, instead of the parser.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand this thinking.  I am working on a large project w/ 
<br>
other people, and our apps use ISO-8859-1.  We want to understand and
<br>
use precisely one encoding, ISO-8859-1.  This is the encoding used in
<br>
our XML documents.  We do not want to handle UTF8 or any other encoding.
<br>
libxml's lack of flexibility in this regard means that we have to add
<br>
code (which I of course simply copied from libxml) to convert from
<br>
an encoding which we have no desire to use to our desired encoding.  One 
<br>
of the features of libxml which initially attracted me was its ability
<br>
to handle multiple encodings.  Now I find that I must use my preferred
<br>
encoding, and in addition translate the encoding used internally by 
<br>
libxml.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There would be some value in the possibility to specify the desired 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encoding for the callbacks, if you have a UTF16 or 8859-x centric 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;application. But this can easily implemented on top of the existing SAX 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;callback.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that there is &quot;value in the possibility to specify the desired 
<br>
encoding for the callbacks&quot; but I would drop the qualification.  I also
<br>
agree that it can easily be implemented, and I propose to do this w/in the
<br>
library.  libxml already does UTF8 -&gt; various other encodings and vice
<br>
versa, so why burden applications w/ the need to write additional code?
<br>
I have no problem with using UTF8 as the default encoding for the SAX 
<br>
callbacks as long as a mechanism exists to determine the encoding used
<br>
in the callbacks.  I realize there will be memory use and performance 
<br>
drawbacks, but if a user requests a certain encoding, and the appropriate
<br>
transcoders exist, that encoding should be used in the callbacks.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In fact I assume some users already have done so and can share their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;code?!
</em><br>
<p>The appropriate means for sharing code is through a library.  Having 
<br>
someone email some code, or copying and pasting code from the library 
<br>
into a project is not.  libxml already knows how to translate from one 
<br>
encoding to another, what I am suggesting is to make this ability 
<br>
available to the user, who should not be forced to use or deal with UTF8. 
<br>
There is already a flexible means for transcoding in the library, why 
<br>
not extend the API to permit this in SAX callbacks?  It would not break 
<br>
existing code, and would benefit projects like mine which do not use 
<br>
UTF8 (which I suspect is a large group of applications).
<br>
<p>What I propose is something along these lines:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;pCtxt = xmlCreatePushParserCtxt(&amp;SAXHandler, NULL, &quot;&quot;, 0, 0);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlSetSAXCallbacksEncoding(pCtxt, &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;);
<br>
<p>Now my application only ever needs to understand ISO-8859-1.
