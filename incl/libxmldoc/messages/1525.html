some alternative subjects for this mail:
<br>
- structural validation of XML files using SAX in libxml
<br>
- semantic parsing of XML documents
<br>
- specific-markup parser generator with libxml
<br>
<p>Hi all,
<br>
<p>I've been using libxml for more than one year and I think it is a really
<br>
great tool. In this year I found myself parsing more than a dozen of
<br>
different markup languages, and each time I had to rewrite several
<br>
&quot;semantic actions&quot; to rebuild the internal data structures that XML was
<br>
representing. This is a very boring and repetitive task. Let us take a
<br>
look at the two alternatives:
<br>
<p>a) DOM. Yeah, if you want to validate a XML file with libxml you must
<br>
built the whole tree. But then you have this recursive structure and is
<br>
is pretty easy to do the right traversal. There are blank nodes to skip,
<br>
your code relies on validation for the correct positioning of node
<br>
children, it is a bit boring to scan over node lists.
<br>
<p>b) SAX. No additional memory is required for this parsing, but you have
<br>
no validation and the parsing proceeds in a sort of top-down fashion,
<br>
which is not what you want in some (most?) cases. In an attempt to make
<br>
SAX parsing easier I implemented a kind of run-time environment with
<br>
association between names and values, with little support for run-time
<br>
type-checking, but the approach was error-prone and resulted in using
<br>
dozens of C macro to access all the environment variables I needed.
<br>
<p>I was looking for an approach for the easy (bottom-up) parsing of a XML
<br>
document, still having the possibility of associating semantic actions
<br>
at each stage of the parsing. Code reusability, code readability and
<br>
easiness of implementation was some of my goals. I had YACC in my mind,
<br>
and the approach I am currently investigating is using YACC as the
<br>
parser, and libxml SAX as the lexer.
<br>
<p>In other words, SAX events coming from libxml are translated into tokens
<br>
for a user-supplied grammar specified in a YACC-like syntax. Semantic
<br>
actions can be associated to grammar reductions and you can use the
<br>
mechanism of semantic values provided by YACC to propagate parsed
<br>
results in a bottom-up manner.
<br>
<p>The following is a trivial example of YAXP grammar:
<br>
<p>%{{
<br>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
<br>
%}}
<br>
<p>%union {{
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gint n;
<br>
}}
<br>
<p>%type &lt;&lt;n&gt;&gt; expr
<br>
%type &lt;&lt;n&gt;&gt; &lt;expr&gt;
<br>
%type &lt;&lt;n&gt;&gt; &lt;constant&gt;
<br>
<p>%%
<br>
<p>main:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;expr {{ printf(&quot;result: %d\n&quot;, $1); }}
<br>
;
<br>
<p>expr:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;expr&gt;
<br>
| &lt;constant&gt;
<br>
| expr &lt;plus&gt; expr {{ $$ = $1 + $3; }}
<br>
| expr &lt;minus&gt; expr {{ $$ = $1 - $3; }}
<br>
| &lt;plus&gt; expr {{ $$ = $2; }}
<br>
| &lt;minus&gt; expr {{ $$ = -$2; }}
<br>
;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&lt;expr&gt;:
<br>
&nbsp;expr
<br>
;
<br>
<p>&lt;constant&gt;:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;TEXT {{ $$ = atoi(YAXP_GET_TEXT($1)); }}
<br>
;
<br>
<p>&lt;plus&gt;:
<br>
;
<br>
<p>&lt;minus&gt;:
<br>
;
<br>
<p>%%
<br>
<p>The grammar is made of rules, rules are made of components. Components
<br>
surrounded by &lt; &gt; are indeed XML elements, the other are non-terminal
<br>
symbols, like in YACC. Thus, I see from the grammar above that &lt;plus&gt;
<br>
and &lt;minus&gt; are EMPTY XML elements, &lt;constant&gt; is an XML element
<br>
containing just characters data, &lt;expr&gt; is an element whose content is
<br>
described by the non-terminal expr.
<br>
Semantic actions are surrounded by {{ }} and semantic values are
<br>
accessed by the same notation as in YACC. There are some facilities for
<br>
attributes, for example, in a rule with the form:
<br>
<p>&lt;table&gt;:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bla bla {{ printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, @border); }}
<br>
<p>you can access the attribute &quot;border&quot; of the element table when it is
<br>
parsed.
<br>
<p>The implementation of all this is fairly easy: I have a little
<br>
processor, yaxp, which translates a YAXP grammar into a YACC file. Then,
<br>
you have to process the resulting grammar with YACC, compile and link
<br>
with a little library for using libxml as &quot;yylex&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well, I tried to sum up what I can do with YAXP right now. The question
<br>
is: does someone find this useful too? Are you interested in
<br>
using/developing/extending YAXP? If so please let me know and I'll make
<br>
a public release of the source code in a few days.
<br>
Any ideas, criticisms, suggestions? (I have many) They are all welcome.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;luca
