<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am concerned that once you start becoming dependent on msvc, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you get into situations like what has happened with ActiveState
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perl.  Now, I have nothing against ActiveState.  They've done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an _excellent_ job.  I am concerned that their toolset having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unique MS-Windows utilities and options could end up eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forking the Perl code base and world.  MS gives ActiveState 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;funding and MS has tried to fragment the Java through embrace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and extend.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.  Don't want critical dependence in on *any* os as far as 
<br>
I am concerned.   So far, Daniel has done an almost unreasonably good
<br>
job.  For instance, relying on lex/yacc/flex/bison to compile would 
<br>
be a complete show-stopper for me, and probably a lot of other win32
<br>
people.  Not that lex/yacc is bad, they are great in fact.  They just 
<br>
don't ship with msvc (unfortunately).  So there is some extra effort
<br>
in the parser on that count.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hope we can agree that any changes necessary to support Win32 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be completely compatible from the API standpoint with the Unix 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;code base.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.  That's why I am using the raw win32 api instead  of
<br>
mfc in my current code (it's not that bad btw, considering its
<br>
age and the amount of backwards compatibility supported). 
<br>
Having a completely api compatible across win32 and unix is 
<br>
in fact the point.  Anyone wanting to use MS specific xml 
<br>
features really should just link to the MS xml parser anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the Cygwin environment works as intended, there wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any changes from the Unix sources necessary.  Of course, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not always possible and a lot of sources &quot;ported&quot; to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under Cygwin have changes that conflict with the msvc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compilers, often involving incorrect use of &quot;#ifdef WIN32&quot; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Cygwin specific #ifdef was what was required. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I completely agree that if libxml were made to work with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cygwin that care should be taken not to conflict with msvc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes.
</em><br>
<p>I like the idea of libxml compiling under everything.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm also in sympathy with Erwin Rol's concerns surrounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cygwin.  In many ways it is an immature environment and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonder if it will ever be useful for programs upon which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people can depend.  Although, you can distribute binaries
</em><br>
<p>In my case, I am collaborating with several others civil engineers,
<br>
some of whom are using fortran on a parallel code base.  It really
<br>
is unreasonable to expect them to master the intricacies of 
<br>
the unix build system.   Much better for them to concentrate
<br>
on writing correct code and doing correct engineering.  The purity 
<br>
of the engineering overides the purity of the build 
<br>
environment.  Having written makefile and done a bit of autoconfiscating
<br>
myself, it just is much easier to use the appropriate tools
<br>
for the platform.  On windows, this will be an ide for 
<br>
most people.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;built on Cygwin with a DLL that doesn't require one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to install the compiler and environment.  Also, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the MINGW32 set of tools, which is the GNU tools and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compilers using the MS C DLLs.  This is another flavor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that might be investigated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>On the other hand, I really like gcc, and frankly, I trust it
<br>
to be a better iso c compiler than msvc.  Which is why I 
<br>
periodically spend a few days blasting my numerical kernel 
<br>
through gcc.  The xml being essentially platform independent
<br>
is a big boon here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, nothing personal here, so don't take it so...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For those of us limited to ms tools, not having libxml
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; means linking ms xml parser.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So there is a bit of give and take here. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a _very_ good point.
</em><br>
<p>libxml can be a &quot;compelling&quot; app for windows developers.
<br>
The more Windows developers that use libxml, the more
<br>
Windows developers will use xml.  It will bootstrap itself.
<br>
The main contribution I think I have made is not at all
<br>
in the libxml code base, nor in its use, but providing
<br>
the msvc ide files.  My goal has been someone should be 
<br>
able to dl what I posted, double click the workspace,
<br>
build it, and use it.  Eventually, I would like to see a 
<br>
win32 subdirectory in the cvs sources for any ide:
<br>
msvc, borland, whatever.  Make it really *easy* for 
<br>
a win32 developer to use it, so easy that they have no 
<br>
excuse not too.  FWIW, its pretty much sop in the Windows world
<br>
to distribute ide files with ssource (and there is a 
<br>
considerable amount of free example code running around the win32
<br>
world, I would be hosed without it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think we're in agreement here, but I would like to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point out that having options surrounding using libxml on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Win32 environments (msvc built, Cygwin, Borland, etc.) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also a good in that it gives people who wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use libxml in Windows environments more flexibility.
</em><br>
<p>I agree; we are thinking more or less along the same lines.
